<h4>Find a Substring in a String</h4>

First Javascript String method comes to mind when we search a substring in a string is `indexOf()` method. ES6 introduced 3 more methods to accomplish similar tasks:

1. The **includes()** method returns true if the given text is found anywhere within the string. It returns false if not.
2. The **startsWith()** method returns true if the given text is found at the beginning of the string. It returns false if not.
3. The **endsWith()** method returns true if the given text is found at the end of the string. It returns false if not.
