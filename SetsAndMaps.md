<h4>Sets and Maps</h4>

Set is a list of values. We use it to check if the value is there. Set is not a replacement for an Array.
Map is a collection of keys. Maps are used as a cache, a quick access to values. ES5 didn't have default `Sets & Maps`. So we used to use Object properties as Sets & Maps.
