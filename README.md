<p>Let's learn ES2015 together. I share my personal Javascript (ES2015) study notes</p>
 -------------------------------

<p> I first learned bits and pieces of ES2015, but after watching Douglas Crockford's talk on ES6 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EF-FO63MXs), I understood how developing Javascript applications using ES6 is so defferent from ES5-way. This is my personal study note on ES6 or ES2015.</p>
