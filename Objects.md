<h4>ES6 Objects</h4>

- <strong>Ordinary Objects</strong> : Objects with Default Internal Behaviours
- <strong>Exotic Objects</strong> : they have different internal behaviours than default objects
- <strong>Standard Objects</strong> could be either Ordinary or Exotic
- All Standard Objects are `built-in objects`
- Built-in Objects become present when a code starts the execution in browsers or Node.js

Object Literals in ES5 is basically name - value pairs. It is short and concise.

```javascript
	"use strict";

	function initialize(name, surname) {
  		var age = 25;
  		return {
    		name: name,
    		surname: surname,
    		age: age
  		};
	}

	console.log(initialize("Max", "Charyyev"));
```
If we look at this example, we can see duplication of function properties and returned object parameters. In ES6, we can make this example even shorter. If object property names are the same as the function parameter names, we can only use object property names. 
Learning ECMAScript 6 Book:
> When a property in an object literal only has a name, the JavaScript engine looks into the surrounding scope for a variable of the same name. If it finds one, that variableâ€™s value is assigned to the same name on the object literal.

We can modify the above example for ES6:
```javascript
	function initialize(name, surname) {
  		var age = 25;
  		return {
    		name,
    		surname,
    		age
  		};
	}

	console.log(initialize("Max", "Charyyev"));
```

<h4>Concise Method Syntax</h4>

ES6 introduces some minor changes to how we define an object method. Have a look at the example below:

```javascript
	// ES5
	var me = {
		name : "Max Charyyev",
		printMyName : function() {
			console.log(this.name);
		}
	};

	// ES6
	var me = {
		name : "Max Charyyev",
		printMyName() {
			console.log(this.name);
		}
	};
	
	me.printMyName();
```
We don't have to specify a name for the method and we don't need a `function` keyword. The rest of the synatx is the same with ES5. `printMyName` method created on `me` object and an anonymous function is assigned to `printMyName` property.

<h4>Square Brackets in Objects</h4>

When we use bracket notation, we can set any string value as an Object property. Object property names with spaces makes it impossible to reference them later using dot notation.

```javascript
	var me = {}, you = {}, name = "your name";

	me["my name"] = "Max Charyyev";
	you[name] = "Alexander Gintsburg";

	console.log(me["my name"]);
	console.log(you[name]);

	var object = {
  		"another name" : "Mary Magpie",
	};

	console.log(object["another name"]);
```
In this example, `name` in `you[name]` is a <strong>computed property name</strong>. In ES6, computed property names are part of the Object Literal Syntax. So, the example below works in ES6:

```javascript
	var name = "your name";

	var object = {
  		"another name" : "Mary Magpie",
  		[name] : "Mathew Hall"
	};

	console.log(object["another name"]);
	console.log(object[name]);
```

<h4>New Global Object Methods</h4>

<strong>Object.is()</strong> method to compare the values.
<strong>Object.assign()</strong> method is introduced to perform object composition in Javascript, to enhance mixin() approach.

Object.is() method works exactly the same with `===`. There are only acouple of cases it will give you more accurate result than `===` operator. 
- +0 and -0 are are not the same in Javascript Engine, but `===` operator will return true when they are compared.
- NaN === NaN will return false, but Object.is() method will return true.

```javascript
	console.log(NaN == NaN);    //false
	console.log(NaN === NaN);   //false

	console.log(+0 == -0);      //true
	console.log(+0 === -0);     //true

	console.log(Object.is(NaN, NaN));   //true
	console.log(Object.is(+0, -0));     //false
```

Object.assign() method:
Mixins are used to shallow copy one object's properties and methods without inheriting from that object.

```javascript
	function mixin(receiver, supplier) {
    Object.keys(supplier).forEach(function(key) {
        receiver[key] = supplier[key];
    });

    return receiver;
}

	var object1 = {
		name : "Max",
		surname : "Charyyev",
		getName : function() {
			return this.name + " - " + this.surname;
		}
	};

	object2 = {};

	mixin(object2, object1);

	object2.getName();
```
Because, this pattern is used often, ES6 added Object.assign() method. It accepts many suppliers. Latest supplier may overwrite the earlier suppliers properties on the receiver.
`Object.assign(receiver, supplier1, supplier2);`

<h5>Overwriting Object Literal properties</h5>

```javascript
	"use strict";

	var learn = {
	javascript : "ES5",
	javascript : "ES6"
	};

	console.log(learn.javascript);
```
This example wouldn't work on ES5 Strict Mode (Syntax Error). It works on ES6 Strict Mode. Latest Object Literal Property value would overwrite the old property value.

<h5>Object's own properties order</h5>

```javascript
	var object = {
  		a:1,
  		c:6,
  		d:3,
  		0:3,
  		3:6,
  		9:2,
  		1:0
	};

	object.b = 34;

	console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object).join(""));	//0139acdb
```
Based on what we see in this `key - value pairs` from the result, we can say that, numeric keys are sorted/grouped together, but all string keys are grouped together but not sorted, they are in the same order as they are added to the object, including the dynamic key added later which comes after the already added keys on the object.

<h4>Change Object Prototype in ES6</h4>

ES5 had object.getPrototypeOf() method to get the object prototype but assumption was the object prototype stays the same after its instatntiation. ES6 introduced a standard way of changing objects' prototype using `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method.

```javascript
	let pretAManger = {
  		action : "you can have a sandwich",
  		whatToEat() {
    		return this.action;
  		}
	};

	let itsu = {
  		action : "you can have noodles",
  		whatToEat() {
    		return this.action;
  		}
	};

	let foodShop = Object.create(pretAManger);
	console.log(foodShop.whatToEat());
	console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(foodShop) === pretAManger);

	Object.setPrototypeOf(foodShop, itsu);

	console.log(foodShop.whatToEat());
	console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(foodShop) === itsu);
```
This example doesn't require much explanation. 
Object prototype values are stored in internal property called [[prototype]].

<h5>`Super` Reference</h5>

ES6 introduced `super` to make it easy to access to any functionality in an object's prototype.

```javascript
	let foodShop = {
  		action : "we serve delicious food",
  		whatToEat() {
    		return this.action;
  		}
	};

	let itsu = {
  		//action : "you can have noodles",
  		whatToEat() {
    		return super.whatToEat() + " and drinks";
  		}
	};

	// foodShop -> itsu -> diner

	Object.setPrototypeOf(itsu, foodShop);
	let diner = Object.create(itsu);

	console.log(foodShop.whatToEat());
	console.log(itsu.whatToEat());
	console.log(diner.whatToEat());

	//we serve delicious food
	//we serve delicious food and drinks
	//we serve delicious food and drinks
	/* 
	Note: 
		If we define `action` on itsu object we will get the result below:
		we serve delicious food
		you can have noodles and drinks
		you can have noodles and drinks
	*/
```
Super references are `NOT` dynamic. In the above example `super.whatToEat()` always refers to fooShop.whatToEat().
If we had to do it ES5 way, we had to use <br/>
`return Object.getPrototypeOf(this).whatToEat.call(this) + ", and drink";` enstead of
`return super.whatToEat() + " and drinks";` in `itsu` object. But we would get and error, when we do `console.log(diner.whatToEat());`.
