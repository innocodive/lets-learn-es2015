<h4>ES6 Objects</h4>

- <strong>Ordinary Objects</strong> : Objects with Default Internal Behaviours
- <strong>Exotic Objects</strong> : they have different internal behaviours than default objects
- <strong>Standard Objects</strong> could be either Ordinary or Exotic
- All Standard Objects are `built-in objects`
- Built-in Objects become present when a code starts the execution in browsers or Node.js
